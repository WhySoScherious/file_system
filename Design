Assignment 3: File System

Purpose:

The purpose of this assignment is an implementation of a file system

The assignment is to:

1) Write a format program that creates a superblock, a free block map, and an initial root directory
for your disk. 
These functions should use a disk that has been created with makedisk and will have
to use opendisk(), seekblock(), and writeblock() to format the disk.

a) superblock should include the size of the partition, the location of the free block map,
   the location of the root directory, and the start of the data blocks.

b) free block map can be a bitmap with 0s for free blocks and 1s for allocated blocks. 
  Include the superblock, root directory, and bitmap blocks in the bitmap. 
  That will make the block numbers correspond to the blocks on your "disk".

c) Write functions to read and write your root directory (writing a directory = creating a file).
   Keep in mind that your files should have an inode, but your inodes may be very simple.
   They can be fixed size (1 block) and need only contain the size of the file and an array of 
   direct block pointers (i.e., a list of block numbers for the blocks in the file).
   
2) Write functions to read and write files on your disk.
   It might be a good idea to start with 1 block files. 

Data:

We are given mydisk.c, mydisk.h, makedisk.c, and testdisk.c

-makedisk.h and makedisk.c consist of functions createdisk, opendisk, seekblock, readblock, and 
 writeblock which we use in our format program file_system.c when we create the superblock, free block map, and inodes.

-The functions we use in our program file_system.c are 
 readblock- read the specified block of the disk file system partition
 writeblock- write the specified block of the disk file system partition
 seekblock- seek to the specific block within the file system partition of a disk file

-testdisk.c - test file for testing our fucntions

-file_system.c and file_system.h is the format program that creates superblock, an initial rootblock, 
 free block map and inodes. 

The functions in file_system.c use a disk made with makedisk.c which was provided for us.


file_system.c/file_system.h:

file_system.h contains structs for the Inodes and the Superblock

#define SUPERBLOCK 0 /* superblock starts at block 0 */
#define ROOTBLOCK  1 /* rootblock  starts at block 1 */
#define FREEBLOCK  2 /* freeblock starts at block 2 */

typedef struct Inode{

  int size;
  int *pointers;
  int nextInodePointer;
  bool isDirectory;
  int block;
  
}Inode;

struct superblock {
unsigned int rootblock;
unsigned int freeblock;
unsigned int datablock;
unsigned int size;
} superblock;


file_system.c:

1. char *int2binstr(unsigned int n)

- converts a decimal number into a binary string 

2. char *int2str( int n)

- converts a decimal number into a string

3. int str2int(char *s)

- converts a character string of decimal numbers to an int

4. void copy2buf(unsigned char *databuf, unsigned char **strings, int  loc)

- copies a string of arbitrary length into a fixed length databuffer.

5. void write_super_block(disk_t disk)
- write superblock
- superblock contains information about rootblock, freeblock, and 
  data block.

6. void read_super_block(disk_t disk)
 -read superblock

7. void write_block_map(disk_t disk, int *bmap)
bmap - array of 0 and 1
-writes the file data in block that is free

8. int *read_block_map(disk_t disk)
- bitmap[i] = 0, block[i] = free
- bitmapi] = 1, block[i] = allocated
- returns a list of ints 

9. Inode* createInode( int size, int * pointers, bool directory, int block)
- crete an inode
- Inodes which represent directories should be size = 0, pointers will be to other inodes
- the max # of pointers is (BLOCK_SIZE-3-(ceil(log10(disk_size))*2)/(ceil(log10(disk_size))+1) 

10. char * intArray2charArray(int * numbers)

 -turns a list of ints into a char array of numbers separated by commas. Will end in a comma.

11. void deleteInode(disk_t disk, Inode* inode)
- safely removes an Inode

12. Inode* writeInode(disk_t disk, int block, int * gpointers,bool directory)
-disk: disk to write to
-block: block to write Inode
-pointers: list of pointers
-directory: whether it's a directory Inode or not.
-must free Inode

13. Inode* readInode(disk_t disk, int block)
- block location on disk of Inode

14. Inode* rewriteInode(disk_t disk, Inode* inode)
 - removes and writes the updated Inode in the old location

Functions above tested in testdisk.c
 
testdisk.c:
1. get_input()
	Gets the user input from keyboard and returns it as a string.
	input: nothing
	output: user input string 
	
2. write_file()
 	Copies a file from your Unix directory into your "disk" directory.
 	input: "disk", file name, and i-node of directory
 	output: i-node block number

3. ls()
 	Lists the files from the "disk" directory and prints file names to
 	screen.
 	input: disk, directory i-node
 	output: nothing

4. check_file()  
	Checks if the file exists on the disk.
	input: "disk", file name, directory i-node
	output: Returns -1 if the file doesn't exist, else return i-node
			number of file.

5. readdisk()  
	Reads a file from your "disk" and prints it out to screen.
	input: disk, block number of file i-node
	ouput: nothing

6. mkdir()
	Creates a directory within the current directory.
	input: disk, current directory i-node, name of new directory
	output: nothing

7. cd()
	Changes the current directory in the "disk".
	input: disk, directory to go to, i-node of current directory
	output: Returns to the previous level directory if "cd .." was
			passed. If the directory exists, return the i-node of the
			directory, else return the current directory.

8. rm()
    Deletes a file from the current directory.
    input: disk, file or directory to remove, i-node of current directory
    output: Returns the i-node of the current directory
